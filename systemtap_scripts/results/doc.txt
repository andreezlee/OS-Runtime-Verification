This is the directory where results file from DaCapo benchmark testing are placed.

Mapping filenames to results:

NOTE: [test name] is a program from the benchmark,
[o] is a monitoring mode (either offline or online)

All files contain multiple trials.

- [test name].txt -> test output without instrumentation or monitoring (includes runtime)
- [test name]_oh_[o].txt -> test output for [o] monitoring (includes runtime)
- [test name]_viol_[x]_[o].txt -> [o] monitoring output for specification [x]
